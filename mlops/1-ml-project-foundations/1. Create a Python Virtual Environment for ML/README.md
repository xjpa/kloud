```
Day 1: Create a Python Virtual Environment for ML
```


The xFusionCorp Industries data science team needs a standardised Python environment for their new ML project. Set up a virtual environment with the required ML libraries on the controlplane host.

Create a Python virtual environment named ml-env under /root/code/ using python3 -m venv.

Activate the environment and install the following packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Generate a requirements.txt file using pip freeze and save it at /root/code/requirements.txt.
